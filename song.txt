Sleight of hand and twist of fate
On a bed of nails she makes me wait
And I wait without you

Sleight of hand and twist of fate
On a bed of nails she makes me wait
And I wait without you

Whith or whithout you
Whith or whithout you

Through the storm we reach the shore
You give it all but I want more
And I'm waiting for you

With or without you
With or without you
I can't live
With or without you
